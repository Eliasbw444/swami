If compiling from CVS
-----------------
You need to run "./autogen.sh" in the toplevel directory. You'll need
autoconf, automake, libtool and perhaps other libraries and there development
packages in order for this to work.


Configure build system
-----------------

Change to toplevel Swami source directory and execute:
./configure

Some useful options to the configure script ("./configure --help" to list more
options) you probably won't need to specify any of these:

--with-audiofile-prefix=PFX  Prefix where AUDIOFILE is installed (optional)
--disable-splash        Don't compile Swami splash intro image

TIPS in using the configure script
-----------------

Support for external libraries is for the most part auto detected. So you
probably won't need to supply any switches to the configure script. If the
configure script does something unexpected or fails it is often useful to
look at the config.log file. If you install or remove a library used by
Swami and you want to re-run configure, you may want to delete
config.cache first.

Required libraries
-----------------

Swami requires a sound file library to load sample files (WAV, AU etc).
Currently only audiofile is supported (libsndfile support soon).

GTK 1.2+ is required. It depends on a number of other libraries as well.
Chances are you already have it.

Optional libraries
-----------------

The libpng library is used for the splash intro image. If you don't have it
you won't get the splash image. You can also force the splash image to not be
compiled (save about 60k in the Swami binary, but lose some of the Swami
atmosphere) with the --disable-splash switch.

Compile and install
-----------------

To compile the package execute:
make

To install the binary file "swami" issue a:
make install

problems or suggestions with the build process.
