If compiling from CVS
---------------------
You need to run "./autogen.sh" in the toplevel directory. You'll need
autoconf, automake, libtool and perhaps other libraries and there development
packages in order for this to work.


Configure build system
----------------------
Change to toplevel libInstPatch source directory and execute:
./configure

Run "./configure --help" to get a list of configure options, you
likely wont need to specify any.


TIPS in using the configure script
----------------------------------
Support for external libraries is for the most part auto detected. So you
probably won't need to supply any switches to the configure script. If the
configure script does something unexpected or fails it is often useful to
look at the config.log file. If you install or remove a library used by
libInstPatch and you want to re-run configure, you may want to delete
config.cache first.


Required libraries
------------------
libInstPatch requires a sound file library to load sample files (WAV, AU etc).
Currently only libsndfile is suppored (audiofile support will be added
sometime).

libsndfile homepage: http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/
audiofile homepage: http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/

glib/gobject 2.x, most newer Linux distributions come with this.

GTK/glib homepage: http://www.gtk.org


Optional stuff
-----------------
If you have gtk-doc the programmers API documentation will be built in
docs/reference/html.

The Python binding will be built if you have pygtk 2.x installed.


Compile and install
-------------------
To compile the package execute:
make

To install libInstPatch:
make install

problems or suggestions with the build process.
